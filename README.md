# 🧠 Deep Learning Image Detection

This project focuses on implementing image detection using deep learning techniques, specifically leveraging the VGG16 architecture. The goal is to accurately classify and detect objects within images.

## ⚙️ How to Run

1. **Clone the Repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mahdijafari78/deep_learning_Image_detectio.git
cd deep_learning_Image_detectio
```

2. **Install Dependencies**

Ensure you have Python 3.7+ installed. Then, install the required packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. **Download Pre-trained Weights**

Place the pre-trained VGG16 weights in the `weight/` directory. Ensure the weights file is named appropriately as expected in `VGG16.py`.

4. **Run the Detection Script**

```bash
python VGG16.py
```

This will process the images in the `image/` directory and save the detection results in the `out_put_img/` directory.
